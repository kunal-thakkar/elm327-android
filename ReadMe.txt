Adapter Status Information
	OBDII to RS232 Interpret. 
Adapter Version 
	ELM327 v1.5 
Adapter Notes 
	Cheap clone versions of this adapter (mostly found via Amazon/eBay) may not function with protocol J1850- PWM(Ford/other), and also may have issues with corrupted communications (resulting in pausing dials or other strange things happening). 
Enhanced MPG Calculation (Enhance the MPG calculation so that it is more accurate. (This may mean slower refresh rates on older vehicles as more sensors are used) - can be set in the OBD2 adapter settings 
	No
Faster communication (Is Torque configured for the fastest possible sensor read speed - this can be changed in the 'OBD2 Adapter Settings' in the app)
	No 
Adapter PID read speed (The rate of PIDs/second that have been read from the ECU. You can increase this by enabling 'Faster Communication' in the OBD2 settings)
	Current: 8.1, Max: 13.9, Avg: 8.0 
Vehicle OBD Standard (The OBD standard that the vehicle ECU conforms to)
	European EOBD 
OBD Protocol (The protocol used to talk to the vehicle ECU)
	IS015765-4CAN11/500 
VIN Code (Vehicle identification number (check against your logbook)
